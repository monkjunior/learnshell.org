## Hello, world!

Bash = "Bourne Again Shell", well another thing relate to history that make you need to Goolge it.

Sha-bang = `#!`

Every shellscript need to start by sha-bang then follow with the full path where shell interpreter is located.
If you provide the wrong path, you will receive the error `Command not found`.

It is common to name the shell script with the ".sh" extension.

## Shell variables

Shell variables are created once they are assigned a value.

A variable can contain a number, a character or a string of characters.

They are case sensitive and can consist of a combination of letters and underscores "_".

Values are assigned to vars by using `=`, no spaces are permitted.

### Referencing the variables

Using backslash `\` to escape the special character meaning.
